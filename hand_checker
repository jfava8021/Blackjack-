###Given 3 integers between 1 and 11, if their sum is less than or equal to 21, 
###return their sum. If their sum exceeds 21 and there's an eleven, reduce the total
###sum by 10. Finally, if the sum (even after adjustment) exceeds 21, return "BUST"

def check_hand(hand):
  sum_hand = sum(hand)
  if sum_hand <= 21:
    print(sum_hand)
  elif hand.count(11) > 1:
    check_aces(hand)
  elif 11 in hand and sum_hand > 21:
    print(sum_hand - 10)
  else:
   print("BUST")

### check_aces needed in case of multiple 11's in hand 
def check_aces(hand):
  if hand.count(11) == 2 and 10 not in hand:
    print(sum(hand) - 10)
  elif hand.count(11) == 3:
    print(13)
  else:
    print("BUST")
